#Ruby Revision
##Makers Academy Week 9 Test

This test was set by Alex Peattie

whilst learning to code at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com).

###Aim 
To revise my knowledge of Ruby. There were 41 failing specs, and we had to make them all pass.

Alex provided an RSpec file and I wrote the code to satisfy the tests. 

At the end there were two extra challenges:
  - writing FizzBuzz without using the modulo method, and
  - generating the lyrics of '99 bottles of beer on the wall'.
